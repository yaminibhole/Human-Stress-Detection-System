# Human-Stress-Detection-System
Human-Stress-Detection-System is an interactive platform designed to predict stress levels based on physiological and environmental features. It utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically a RandomForestRegressor algorithm, to provide accurate stress level predictions. Users can input specific physiological data such as snoring rate, respiration rate, body temperature, limb movement, blood oxygen level, rapid eye movement, sleep hours, and heart rate to generate personalized stress level predictions. The platform not only predicts stress levels but also offers tailored suggestions and recommendations based on the predicted stress level, empowering users to take proactive steps towards stress management and promoting overall well-being.

# Features
The Stress Detection sysytem offers several key features:

1. Predict Stress Levels: Users can input physiological and environmental data to receive predictions about their stress levels.
2. Explore Scenarios: The platform allows users to experiment with different feature values to explore various stress scenarios.
3. Feedback System: Users can provide feedback and suggestions for improving the platform.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

# Running the Project
To run the Stress Detection Explorer, execute the following command: streamlit run main.py
